# chakula
Android Engineer assessment

Chakula is a native mobile application made with Jetpack using Kotlin. It enables a user to browse a catalog of products, add desired products to cart,
choose a mode of payment from an API, checkout and view past orders.

The App is built offline first enabling you to pick up where you left off and minimise network requests.

## Running the app
Download the latest version of Android Studio
Once Android Studio is ready, clone this project on your machine and open it up as a project on Android Studio

Navigate to `app/src/main/java/com/example/chakula`

Here you will find the App uses the MVVM architecture, with the `data`, `model`, `ui` and `utils`. All views are found in the ui folder as well as their accompanying
components and viewModel.

In total, there are 4 views.
